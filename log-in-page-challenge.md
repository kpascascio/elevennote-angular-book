# Part 10: Log In page Challenge

## Step 1. Challenge Create a login page

The goal for this challenge is to let you drive most of the content from what you have learned in this tutorial, as also what you know from just being a developer!

The challenge for this Module is to create the login page, which consist of:

* Building the login page component with **Angular CLI**. 
* Building out the form with Angular forms in the Controller. 
* Building the HTML page that has the **Material Form** on it.
* Adding a path to the Login page.
* Including an **onSubmit\(\)** method in the Login page component. 
* Injecting the Auth Service so that you can use the **login\(\)** method

For this challenge give yourself **45 minutes to 1 hour** before looking at the solution, yes that amount of time.

Focus on writing things from memory and the process we’ve done thus far.

The point of this challenge is to really push you, and it’s up to you to keep you accountable!

Good luck.

## Step 2. Challenge Answer

If you’ve gone down the list in the previous step that is exactly how we will build the solution.

Also since everything that will be built isn’t new i’ll post just the screenshots, with minimal explanation.

## Step 3. Adding RouteLink to our Header

We have some awesome buttons in our header that just aren’t being used, Let’s add functionality to them!

When we import the Route component into our application we are given an **Attribute Directive**, **routerLink**.

Think of **routerLink** like the anchor `<a>` tag element. What does the anchor tag do?

It allows us to link out to other webpages! And so does **routerLink**, but it only navigates to routes inside of our application.
